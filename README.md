# Starbucks Promotions
Optimizing Starbucks promotion strategy.

## Installation
### Libraries
I've mainly used standard Python libraries throughout the project. However, as I did face issues upgrading to the latest version of scikit-learn with Anaconda, I've decided to list the most important packages and corresponding version numbers used:
- ```python 3.6.7```
- ```pandas 0.23.4```
- ```numpy 1.15.4```
- ```scikit-learn 0.20.2```
- ```xgboost 0.81```

For all plotting purposes I've used ```matplotlib``` & ```seaborn```.

### Data
The data sets being used consist of simulated data from Starbucks and was provided in Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. Please see "Files" section for further information.
